## Overview

Photova is a responsive, dynamic photography portfolio website. It features file upload and download capabilities to display and share work. A prospective photography client will be able to; customize how the work is displayed, categorizing images into different galleries, choose how many galleries they would like displayed publicly, and have separate detailed views for each gallery. The website is also able to provide downloadable versions of images to an end-user. This will give the client the ability to share their work with their respective clients, a necessary service to a photographer's business.
